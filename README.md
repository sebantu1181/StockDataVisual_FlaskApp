# StockDataVisual_FlaskApp

## Project Objectives

To extend the functionality of project 3 by making it accessible on the web.
To further gain experience and develop skill working with Docker and Flask.
To further develop team chemistry and communication skill.

## Description
In this project you will extend the software application you developed in project 3 to be accessible on the web. You will achieve this using Docker and Flask. Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. Docker is currently an industry-leading tool for developing containerized software applications. Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework that allows developers to create web applications using Python.

Your flask application will get user input from a web form instead of the console like you used in project 3. You will also write code to populate an option box with stock symbols for the user to choose from. Your application should not crash.

Teams are encouraged to collaborate and work together on this project but everyone will submit their work individually. This project does not have to be managed in Jira. The team should work together in helping each other to understand Docker, Flask, how to implement your code, and develop a solution to populate the stock options.
